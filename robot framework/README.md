robot framework tests

Here a couple of scripts using robot framework. I focused on the CLI use of this automation testing tool. First ipmression is rather bad.

What I do not like with robot framework:
- I have to learn a new DSL
-- This one is complicated
-- It is hard to see the link between the code and the keywords
- Very few examples using SSH
-- we find the same example on the Internet; the one of SSHLibrary
-- on the Internet most of them are for Web applications
- "CryptographyDeprecationWarning" messages on a correct test because "cryptography" library is not including a fixe requested 5 months ago; that does not give a good impression for a long term use of this piece of software
